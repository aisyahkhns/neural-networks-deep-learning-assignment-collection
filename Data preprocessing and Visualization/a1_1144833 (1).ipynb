The final results are as instructed. My weakness is that I occasionally forget to translate logic into concise/idiomatic code, which takes time to clean up the implementation (e.g., bin consistency, color/label mapping, and pandas operation chaining). This is an area I'm working on improving."

    "- How you used it (lookup / debugging / code snippet) (使用的方式) = I use ChatGPT for debugging and lookup, especially when I forget Python/Pandas/Matplotlib syntax or logic. ChatGPT helps me add additional functions to achieve the desired results. For example, when replacing missing data (?), I forgot to add a regular expression option, resulting in imperfect results. Furthermore, when creating visualizations, I had difficulty adding poor and rich labels, so I tried to improve my coding with ChatGPT's help.\n",
    "- How you modified and understood the result (修改與理解過程) = I didn't copy the answers directly, but instead read the results from ChatGPT and adapted them to my needs. For example, I learned why regex=True is necessary to ensure ? is recognized as a missing value, then I retested it with isna().sum(). For visualization, I understood how to map colors and labels so the legend displays as instructed. This way, I wasn't just copying and pasting, but also understood the logic of the code changes and validated the results."

    "I started by loading the data, then replacing the '?' values ​​with NaN using replace with the regex=True option. This is important because if they weren't replaced with NaN, they wouldn't have been identified as missing. I then counted the number of rows with missing values ​​(±3,620) and cleaned them with dropna(). Finally, I created a histogram visualization of the age distribution by income category, with orange for poor (<=50K) and blue for rich (>50K).\n",

    "From this experience, I learned that handling missing values ​​can be tricky—for example, using numpy.nan to ensure pandas recognizes the data as truly missing.
