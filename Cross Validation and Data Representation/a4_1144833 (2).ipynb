    "In this assignment, I built a complete data preprocessing pipeline for the UCI Adult Income dataset. I loaded the data with pandas, identified 3,620 rows with missing values, removed them, and obtained a working table of 45,222 rows and 15 columns. The target column income was converted to integers (<=50K → 0, >50K → 1). I applied one-hot encoding to the gender column with drop_first=True and label encoding to the remaining categorical features. Using DataFrame.pop(), I separated the target from the features, producing X with 14 feature columns and Y as the target. I standardized all feature columns with StandardScaler and confirmed the transformed matrix shape of (45,222, 14). I then split the data into training and test sets with an 80/20 stratified split and, on the training set, performed 3-fold stratified cross-validation using StratifiedKFold (n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=100), reporting the data and shapes for each fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow reinforced key best practices: encode categorical variables before scaling, standardize features after separating the target, use stratification to preserve class balance in splits, and fix random states for reproducibility."
